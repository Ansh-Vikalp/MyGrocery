#### ```👉Aim- To design an app which keep track of your day to day grocery item need to be purchased  ```

## Acknowledgement

<p>This Project has been made as a part of my SmartInternz-Google Virtual Internship Program. This internship was based on development of Android📲 application from Kotlin as its Language. I would thank all the who involved in providing such valuable skill.</p>


## Description

All of us visit our local market 🛍 to buy daily stuff's .
Remember your old days when, like me when your Mummy used to told you to have some items or RASHANS 
from Local Kirana's store. But if you could relate it was quite troblesome to hold these list items name and their respective quantity in 
our mind. Either we tried to repeat these items in brain🤔 in path  to marketplace or make a paper list📝 also, we didn't get to know exactly we need to buy these stuffs.
   
Due to that we are provided with some extra money🤑 at while at the time of purchasing if any money got left then for Obvious i buy chocolate🍫 as reward.

So, here comed with a solution MyGrocery which has following key features-
- ✔Add any item to list (Name, Quantity, Rate).
- ✔Delete items from the list.
- ✔Total cost made while purchasing certain quantity of item.
  

A thanks to this app where we no longer need to remember 🍓List. It has very simple eay to use interface which allow people from any age group to use it.

>So keep adding item to cart and have fun!😊
  
  
## Architecture 🛠
The app consists of some backend files containing functionalities of app as-
1.  ***Grocery Database-*** Denotes database💾 class for my Grocery. 
2. ***Grocery Item-*** This file contain the abstract of our grocery item table with attributes (itemName, itemQuantity, itemPrice, id as primary key).
3. ***GroceryRvAdapter-*** This class is to configure our recylerView Adapter.
4. ***GroceryViewmodel-*** A GroceryViewmodel class contains functions to insert, delete an item.
5. ***MainActivity-*** This is our main class which corresponds to activity main.xml and contains logic for varoius events.
6. ***MyGroceryDao-*** A data access object class contains queries operation.
  

Beside this the frontend part has two layouts-
1. ***activity_main.xml-*** It is first screen of our app when opened and contains list of items in recycler view.
2. ***add_dialog.xml-*** It is a cardview layout file to insert an item in list.
